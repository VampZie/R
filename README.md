# R: Basics of Biostatistics
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Basics of R, Mainly Biostatistics. As you are here, I do consider that you are already aware of theoretical and problem solving of basic statistics. I am only going to show how to apply it effectively over the datasets.

## EXERCISE : 1
- **Applying Basic Statistics**, basic statistics have Mean, Median, Mode, Standard Deviation, Correlation and Regression.
- R has prebuilt functions for all above-mentioned statistical functions except Mode, for that at line 6 I made it a standard Mode function.

## EXERCISE : 2
- **Analysis of protein sequence and structure data** using various statistical parameters. Key tasks include:
    - Amino acid composition analysis
    - Molecular weight calculation
    - Isoelectric point (pI) determination
    - Hydrophobicity index evaluation (Kyte-Doolittle scale)
    - Secondary structure prediction
    - RMSD, RMSF analysis for protein flexibility and stability
