# R
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Basics of R, Mainly Biostatistics. As you are here,  i do consider that you are already aware of theorical and problem solving of basic statistics. I am only going to show how to apply it effectively over the datasets.

EXERCISE : 1
    - Applying Basic Statistic, basic statistics have Mean, Median, Mode, Standard Deviation, Correlation and Regression.
    - R have prebuild functions for all above mentioned statistics functions except Mode, for that at line 6 i made it standard Mode function.

EXERCISE : 2
    -Analysis protein sequence and structure data using various statistical parameters. Key tasks include:
        -Amino acid composition analysis
        -Molecular weight calculation
        -Isoelectric point (pI) determination
        -Hydrophobicity index evaluation (Kyte-Doolittle scale)
        -Secondary structure prediction
        -RMSD, RMSF analysis for protein flexibility and stability
