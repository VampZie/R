# Protein Structure Analysis - Extension of Exercise 1

This exercise is an application-based extension of Exercise 1 over protein structure data and sequence using statistical parameters.

**I am using PDB FASTA format file, PDB ID: 8Z73**

## Following are the tasks I'll be showing:

### 1. Statistical Parameters You Can Analyze  
**For Sequences (Primary Structure)**  
_Required packages_: `Biostrings` or `seqinr`

- Amino acid frequency or composition (e.g., % of Gly, Ala, etc.)
- Molecular weight of the sequence
- Isoelectric point (pI) and charge at different pH
- Hydrophobicity index (e.g., using Kyte-Doolittle scale)
- Shannon entropy (sequence complexity)
- Amino acid diversity / richness
