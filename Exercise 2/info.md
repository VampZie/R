This exercise is application based extension of exercise 1 over Protein structure data and sequence using statistical parameters.

I am using PDB fasta formate file, PDB ID: 8Z73

Following work i'll be showing are:
**Statistical Parameters You Can Analyze**
  => For Sequences (Primary Structure):
    - Amino acid frequency or composition (e.g., % of Gly, Ala, etc.)
    - Molecular weight of the sequence
    - Isoelectric point (pI) and charge at different pH
    - Hydrophobicity index (e.g., using Kyte-Doolittle scale)
    - Shannon entropy (sequence complexity)
    - Amino acid diversity / richness
**required packages are _Biostrings_ or _seqinr_**
