Following are the work i'll be showing:

1. Statistical Parameters You Can Analyze
   => For Sequences (Primary Structure) [ required packages - Biostarings or seqinr ]:
       - Amino acid frequency or composition (e.g., % of Gly, Ala, etc.)
       - Molecular weight of the sequence
       - Isoelectric point (pI) and charge at different pH
       - Hydrophobicity index (e.g., using Kyte-Doolittle scale)
       - Shannon entropy (sequence complexity)
       - Amino acid diversity / richness
